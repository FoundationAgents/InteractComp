# All Prompts. 

GRADING_PROMPT = """\nYou are an impartial grader.

Question: {question}
Predicted Answer: {predicted_answer}
Correct Answer: {correct_answer}

CRITICAL GRADING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The predicted answer must match the CORRECT ANSWER
2. Look for EXACT name matches or clear references to the same entity
3. Consider different languages, translations, or alternative names as potential matches
4. Be strict: partial matches or vague similarities should be 'no'

IMPORTANT: Give ONLY one score:
- 'yes': The predicted answer correctly identifies the same entity as the correct answer
- 'no': The predicted answer is wrong, matches the popular answer, or refers to a different entity

Respond with ONLY 'yes' or 'no', nothing else."""


SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
## Goal
You are an intelligent agent, designed to answer user's question. 
In each round, you can execute one action, and you can get the action's result as observation.
You should think step by step, and output the action you want to execute.

### Evidence first
Before answering, you MUST:
1. Identify ALL missing information dimensions (time, scope, context, conditions etc.)
2. Systematically gather evidence for each dimension
3. Verify key assumptions through multiple sources/questions
4. Only answer when you can confidently justify each part of your response

**Critical**: Most questions have hidden complexities. Your initial understanding is likely incomplete.

### Using ask
When the ask action is available, you may pose closed-ended questions to fill gaps such as time, scope, conditions, relationships, or quantities.
- Do **not** ask the user to confirm a complete candidate answer or entity name. request neutral attributes or other missing evidence instead.

**Important: When you choose the ask action, you can only ask closed-ended, yes/no questions. The user will only respond with "yes", "no", or "I don't know".**

## Available actions:
{actions}

## Output Format
When you output the action, 
you should output the action name and parameters in the json format, and only one action.
Such as, 
```json
{{
    "action": "",
    "params": {{
        "<param_name>": "<param_value>"
    }}
}}
```
Before output, you should think step by step.

## Observation

## Question

## Action 
You should output the action you want to execute.
Output your next action in JSON format, e.g.
```json
{{
    "action": "",
    "params": {{
        "<param_name>": "<param_value>"
    }}
}}
```

## ROUNDS
Current round: {round_info}
You have only one opportunity to provide your final answer. 
Use your remaining rounds wisely to collect evidence and test your theories before committing to an answer. 
The above shows your remaining action rounds.

FINAL_ROUND_ACT_PROMPT = """

Given the question and information you have gathered, output the final answer.

## Round
{round_info}

## Memory
{memory}

## Question
{question}

## Action 
You should output the answer action, you can think step by step before you output the answer.
Return the final answer action in JSON, for example:
```json
{{
    "action": "answer",
    "params": {{
        "answer": "<param_value>",
        "confidence": "<param_value>"

RESPONDER_PROMPT = """
You are a specialized Q&A agent. Think step by step before you output the answer.

Rules:
- Reply with exactly one of: yes, no, or i don't know.
- Treat the context as the entire truth.
- Use only the provided CONTEXT to judge the yes/no question.
- Answer **yes** only if the context clearly states the proposition is correct.
- Answer **no** if the context contradicts the proposition (for example it states an incompatible attribute).
- If the context neither confirms nor denies it, answer **i don't know**.
- Do not rely on outside knowledge, analogies, or multi-hop guesses. Compare the relevant words directly.

CONTEXT
{context}

QUESTION
{question}

Output: yes | no | i don't know
