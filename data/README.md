# InteractComp (Encrypted Release)

InteractComp accompanies the paper **"INTERACTCOMP: Evaluating Search Agents with Ambiguous Queries"** (Deng et al., 2025). The benchmark targets a capability gap in modern search agents: recognizing ambiguity, asking clarifying questions, and only then executing retrieval or answering. Despite rapid progress on fully specified web queries, the paper shows that interaction-centric performance remains stagnantâ€”highlighting InteractComp as both an evaluation suite and a training ground for interactive behaviors.

## What's Inside
- **210 human-authored tasks** spanning 9 web domains. Each instance includes an intentionally ambiguous question, targeted context for disambiguation, the ground-truth answer, and metadata (`id`, `domain`).
- **Target-distractor methodology:** curators select a target entity and a popular distractor, write questions using only shared attributes, then provide minimal context that exposes the target's unique traits. Ambiguity can only be resolved through interaction.
- **Interaction sensitivity:** the paper reports that GPT-5 tops out at **13.73% accuracy** under standard agent settings but exceeds 24% when forced to interact extensively. Supplying the full disambiguating context pushes accuracy to 71.5%, demonstrating that the limiting factor is proactive interaction rather than reasoning.
- **Longitudinal findings:** over 15 months (May 2024 to Sep 2025) agent accuracy on BrowseComp increases seven-fold, yet InteractComp accuracy stagnates between 6% and 14%, exposing a systemic blind spot in agent development.
- **Transparent pipeline:** the appendix details a five-step construction process (Target and Distractor selection -> Shared and Distinct attributes -> Ambiguous question -> Context snippets -> Reasoning path) ensuring each item is challenging to shortcut yet straightforward to verify post-interaction.

## Repository Layout

```
data/
|-- dataset/
|   `-- InteractComp210.encrypted.jsonl   # Encrypted benchmark samples 
|-- interactcomp_decrypt_jsonl.py     # Decryption utility
```

## Encryption Scheme
- A shared canary token (default `InteractComp`) is embedded in the `canary` column of every record.
- Fields `domain`, `question`, `answer`, and `context` are XOR-encrypted byte-wise using a SHA-256 stream derived from that token, then Base64 encoded.

## Decryption Instructions

1. Prepare Python 3.8+.
2. Place the encrypted JSONL and the decryption script in your working directory (or provide explicit paths).
3. Run:

```bash
python interactcomp_decrypt_jsonl.py \
  --input InteractComp210.encrypted.jsonl \
  --output InteractComp210.decrypted.jsonl
```

Optional flags:
- `--fields` to target a different comma-separated list of encrypted columns.
- `--canary-field` if the canary column name differs from `canary`.
- `--canary-value` to supply the token manually when the canary column has been removed from the encrypted file.
- `--keep-canary` to retain the canary column in the decrypted output.

### Verifying the Result
Decrypted records should be valid UTF-8 JSON lines matching the original dataset. Use diff tools or hash comparisons against an authorized plaintext copy. If a record fails to decrypt, confirm that the canary value you used matches the one embedded during encryption.

## Token Management
- Keep the shared canary token confidential if you want to avoid casual decryption. Rotate it and regenerate the encrypted release if exposure is suspected.
- Consider producing per-recipient encrypted variants (unique tokens) when auditing access or tracing potential leaks.
